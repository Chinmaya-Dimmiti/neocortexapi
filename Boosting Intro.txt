Analyse and Describe Boosting Algorithm

1.Boosting
  The main idea behing boosting is the SDRs of symbols will use a wider range of cells by making the most active cells less active and the least active cells more active.
  This is done via scalar multiplication of a boosting matrix over the spatial pooler to change permeances of each cells.

First we need to understand Neocortex
Neocortex: 
It is like a sheet of napkin squeezed into a skull just below the dura matter of the skull consisting of all the areas required for cognition.To understand the basis of artificial general intelligence
we need to decipher the intelligence of neocortex.

It mainly consists of 6 steps
1. Sparse Distributed Representation
2. Encoding
3. Spatial Pooling
4. Learning
5. Boosting
6. Temporal Pooling

By using Spatial Pooling we will do the above 6 steps. So we need to get idea about Spatial Pooling

While going through the document I come to know about what exactly Spatial Poolong is

It is the layer that processes the Spatial features of the input data in HTM Algorithm.

Spatial Pooling Algorithm Important terms

1. Column
2. Mini-column
3. Inhibition
4. Inhinition radius
5. Active duty cycle
6. Overlap duty cycle
7. Receptive field 
8. Permanence value
9. Permanence threshold
10. Synapse
